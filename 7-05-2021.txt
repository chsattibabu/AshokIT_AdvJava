A-1000 --B
Read of A(1000)
Write of A(10000-1000) 9000
Read the B Details()
Write the B(2000+1000) 3000

I--- Isolation---------All the operations should be done independently.
D--- Durability----- Once transction has Completed and changes are done in the database.Transctions should be perminent. 

Different Types of Transactions:-
